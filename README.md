beeper
======

Beeper is a simple Android Beeper application so that it's easy to use a phone as a pager with SMS/MMS. I wrote this application because Klaxxon seemed overly complicated to me and didn't support MMS.

It lives in the Google and Amazon stores here, if you just want a finished product:
* [Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007KAX4SS/?tag=biswinsu-20)
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aggienerds.beeper)
